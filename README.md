 Project Title: Anat_Hub: Immersive AR Learning App for Human Musculoskeletal System

Project Description:
Anat_Hub is an innovative mobile application designed to revolutionize the study and teaching of the human musculoskeletal system. Leveraging augmented reality (AR) technology, Anat_Hub provides learners and educators with an immersive and interactive learning experience that enhances understanding and retention of anatomical concepts related to muscles, attachments, and actions of the upper and lower limbs.

Key Features:

Immersive AR Experience:
Users can explore realistic 3D models of human muscles in augmented reality, allowing them to visualize anatomical structures in real-world environments.
AR mode enables users to place virtual muscle models in their physical surroundings, providing a hands-on learning experience that enhances spatial understanding.
Comprehensive Muscle Database:
Anat_Hub offers a comprehensive database of muscles of the upper and lower limbs, including detailed information on names, attachments, and actions.
Users can access informative descriptions, diagrams, and animations for each muscle, aiding in comprehension and memorization.
Interactive Glossary:
The application features an interactive glossary with definitions and explanations of anatomical terms related to the musculoskeletal system.
Users can easily search for specific terms and access relevant information to deepen their understanding of anatomical concepts.
Quiz and Assessment Features:
Anat_Hub includes interactive quizzes and assessments to reinforce learning and assess users' knowledge of muscle names, attachments, and actions.
Users can customize quiz parameters such as difficulty level, topic focus, and question types to tailor their learning experience.
Progress Tracking and Personalized Learning:
The app offers progress tracking features that allow users to monitor their learning journey and track their performance over time.
Personalized learning recommendations are provided based on users' quiz results and learning preferences, fostering self-regulated learning habits.
